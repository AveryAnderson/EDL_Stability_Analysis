# EDL_Stability_Analysis
For the final project of my Matrix Methods Linear Algebra course, we analyzed the stability of the control system that defines the speed circuitry of the robot I created for my Electronics Design Lab course.

This Matlab Live Script uses linear algebra techniques to characterize both the stable second order system used in the robot's initial design, and the unstable third order system used in our project.  More information on the circuitry and math described in the project can be found on the project page of my website.
